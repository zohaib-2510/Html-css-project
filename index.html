        <p class="p">The iPhone is a series of smartphones made by Apple Inc since 2007. It is a mobile phone, meaning that it makes calls and sends text messages without wires. There are many types of iPhones, such as the main models and others, such as the mini or pro editions.

            The iPhone can access the Internet as well, either using a cellular network or over Wi-Fi. Like an iPod, it can play music and videos that have been downloaded from the Internet directly, or which have been put on it by connecting it to a personal computer.
            
            The iPhone doesn't have as many buttons as other phones, such as those made by companies like Motorola and Nokia. Instead, it had a touch screen that covers much of the front of the phone. People control the phone by touching the screen.</p>
